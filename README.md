<h1> Understanding Pyhton</h1>
<br>
<h3>The purpouse of this repository</h3>
<p> This repository focus on develop my skills into pyhton development, with the obejct to improve the capacity of how i solve problems using this language</p>
<br>
<h3>Do this repository accepts only Pyhton?</h3>
<p>No, this repository is open to another languages too, but major pyhton has to be used here, after all is a repo dedicated to receives pyhton appllications. However other languagues have the obligation to create a connnection with pyhton, for example the R used here neeeds the transformed data made previously in Pyhton.</p>
<br>
<h3>Keeping forward</h3>
<p>For the future i desire to pursuit new challenges and contributes to my knwoledge about all the possibilities of Pyhton.</p>
